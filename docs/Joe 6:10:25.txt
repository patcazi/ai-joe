[Speaker 1]
Pat last night I believe sent you an email asking if we could book on the company card a trip down to Orange County. This Friday I'm going to meet with them for dinner. We're going to set up the initial terms and then also come back in a couple of weeks to start touring our existing facilities as well as some real estate options as well.

I just wanted to put that on your radar. Is that okay?

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I thought the business model sucked and I thought it was terrible. Oh, interesting. So I have zero interest in signing a deal like that.

Okay, cool. And so that's what I was asking on all this stuff.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, yeah.

[Speaker 2]
It's a shitty deal.

[Speaker 1]
I don't know where you came up with it. I think he's been using Claude and he's been working with Niraj about triangulating, trying to find the best business model. I've seen a long email thread of him going back and forth to Niraj about the deal terms.

So I kind of assumed that that's why it was okay. But he's actually preparing a new one. Okay.

So I think if you're interested I'll have him send it to you and have you review it. And I think also things are fluid as well, right? This is a brand new business line.

[Speaker 2]
It is. We're going to be like IMG. We're going to be below IMG pricing.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
That doesn't make sense. Yeah, I think Pat's… Yeah, my price is I have to discount because I suck.

Yeah. And I'm like, then why are you paying her so much money? No, that's right.

Why are you giving her 40% of the equity? Why are you giving her 40% of the profit share? That's right.

Why are you giving this fucking sweetheart deal and being like, I can't get any… What are you getting for it? No, that makes sense.

[Speaker 1]
So I think what Pat… So just… Pat and I talked about it and it was like, we would like to do an IMG style academy, but on the first run, in the first year, we don't have that brand and credibility of IMG academy that they've built over decades, right?

[Speaker 2]
Yeah. Okay, well I don't want to fund a non-IMG academy one.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, fair enough. So okay, we'll go back to the drawing table. Can I have Pat email you the…

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I want a good business plan that's super compelling. Okay. But no, I don't have any interest in giving hundreds of thousands of dollars and a shitty equity split with shitty profit sharing with I take all the fucking risk and all the downside and at the end of it, I get this shit.

Yeah, no, that's fair. And so I'm like, I'm not excited about it. Okay.

Now, is there a theoretically awesome business plan around all this stuff? Yeah, yeah. Yes.

Okay, great. But that's not… That's not what you had in mind.

[Speaker 1]
But also, we didn't have that feedback, right? Or at least Pat didn't because Pat's handling the terms working with Niraj. Okay.

So that's… I was kind of under the assumption that this was okay, but I didn't realize after this conversation with you that things are obviously need to change, right? And I'm happy to relay that to Pat myself.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, the deal terms, right? I read the term sheet. I'm like, this is a day, right?

The…

[Speaker 1]
yeah, I need a…

[Speaker 2]
back to this high end. Yeah. Right?

I'd love a business plan independent of this one person. Okay. Who's really good.

Yeah. Right? That's a really good okay.

I'm super bored on build a great IMG to do it. Building an IMG requires massive facility spend. No, it doesn't.

There's no such thing as awesome IMG without great facility spend.

[Speaker 1]
Yes.

[Speaker 2]
And you're like, oh, and you literally just don't even have it in the business plan. Yeah. Right?

It's just not even there. Okay. Like you didn't even think of it.

[Speaker 1]
Okay.

[Speaker 2]
And I'm like, well, how are you going to build an IMG at low pricing when you have to buy… put so much into facilities? That's fair.

And then how are you going to do it when you're giving all the economics to the coach? IMG doesn't give those fucking deal terms to anybody.

[Speaker 1]
Okay.

[Speaker 2]
So why are you giving it to them?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Back to expertise. Show expertise. Okay.

There's no expertise being shown.

[Speaker 1]
Okay.

[Speaker 2]
I'm not impressed. Right? I'm glad you have a relationship.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
There's no expertise being shown.

[Speaker 1]
Okay.

[Speaker 2]
Great for you. And so that would be… right?

That's what I'm looking for. Okay. And when I look at it and I'm not…

I don't have tons of expertise in IMG. Yeah. Right?

But it seems like I have a lot more than you guys are demonstrating after you've been working on this for how long? Yeah. Right?

Okay. Great feedback. Thank you.

[Speaker 1]
I'll have them contact you. Thanks, Joe. Thanks.

What's up, TJ? What's up, guys? How'd it go?

Not good. Not good? Yeah, which is kind of surprising because I had a good constructive going back and forth, but apparently that's not the final decision.

It's about the event? No, no, no. Not at all.

It's about going to Orange County to open up an IMG-style academy out there. But I haven't been handling the terms of it at all. I'm there to advocate for the coach and build that relationship to establish trust so he'll open that school, right?

Yeah. So I don't really know exactly.

[Speaker 2]
Does Joe know about what Pat's doing?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. I mean, he literally just said he doesn't like it. He doesn't understand it.

So I'm like, well… It's hard for me to defend it, right? Because as much as I think I know about it, I'm not the guy who came up with it, right?

But I've got to go back to the drawing table. I'll see you guys later. Have a good one.

I mean, I don't know, actually. It's kind of like… Basie said he didn't like it.

No, he didn't like it.
